# How to configure a TP-Link RE450 to repeat/bridge an existing WiFi network to LAN and WiFi

## Setup

You need two machines, one of which can connect to the RE450 over Ethernet. Start by plugging the RE450 in and connecting to it over Wifi.

## Install LEDE on the device

Go [here](https://lede-project.org/toh/views/toh_fwdownload) and find the download link for the RE450. It should look like `https://downloads.lede-project.org/releases/17.01.4/targets/ar71xx/generic/lede-17.01.4-ar71xx-generic-re450-squashfs-factory.bin`.

Follow the instructions from the RE-450 [manual](http://static.tp-link.com/1910012039_RE450_V2_UG.pdf) in section 5.4, "To update the firmware locally," to flash the LEDE image you downloaded to the router.

## Connect to the router using the LEDE interface

Connect to the RE450 over Ethernet and visit 192.168.1.1. Set a new root password and enable Dropbear.

## Configure the LAN connection

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.nerd-quickies.net/2017/04/03/setup-lanwlan-bridge-with-openwrt-luci/), except, at step 7, install the package `luci-proto-relay` as well

## Configure the WiFi connection
